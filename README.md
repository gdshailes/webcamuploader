# WEBCAMUPLOADER

This is a simple Windows service that I wrote to run on an old laptop and upload a still image from a web camera every so often. Its intended purpose was to feed images to the Boriscam page on my website, where I can keep an eye on what our snake Boris gets up to during the day (not a lot, as it turns out).
